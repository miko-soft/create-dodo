# What is the DoDo Framework
The DoDo is easy to learn JavaScript framework which helps developers to build reactive, single page applications.

It can be used for mobile applications, browser extensions, electron desktop apps, ...etc.

The Dodo Framework is not based on UI components like Angular 2+, Vue and React but on Model-View-Controller what makes Dodo more simple and flexible. The inspiration was found in Angular 1, so Dodo conception is similar to it.

Built in modern ES 6+ Javascript.
